# CASA WebApp Guidance  

This repository provides guidance on obtaining the CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) certification for web applications. It includes requirements, best practices, and security configurations needed to meet CASA standards.

## Why looking to be CASA certified?  
The CASA assessment is based on OWASP's Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), ensuring a consistent and industry-recognized approach to securing applications. It provides a structured set of security requirements designed to harden applications against modern threats, aligning with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

CASA certification (Tier 2) is required by some cloud providers including Google to enable access to specific services like Gmail's IMAP server.
