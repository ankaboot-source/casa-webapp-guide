## Web Application Security: Real-world journey to CASA certification

## Abstract  
When Google mandated Cloud Application Security Assessment (CASA) Tier 2 certification for accessing their IMAP server, we thought our security practices were already rock-solid. With firewall rules, Fail2ban for DDoS prevention, regular pentesting, and secure coding practices, we were confident in our "secure by design" approach for our Web Application. But CASA had other plans—60+ rigorous requirements that challenged our assumptions and pushed us to rethink our security posture.  

In this talk, we’ll share our journey from initial shock to successful certification in just a few weeks. You’ll learn how we tackled unexpected challenges, prioritized requirements, and uncovered hidden risks along the way. Whether you’re preparing for CASA or simply looking to strengthen your cloud application security, this session will provide actionable insights, tips, and strategies to help you succeed.

## Steps of the Talk  
1. **Secure by Design? Think Again.**  
   - How Google’s CASA Tier 2 requirement for IMAP access revealed gaps in our security.  
   - The reality of "secure by design" vs. compliance-driven security.  

2. **The CASA Wake-Up Call**  
   - A deep dive into the 60+ requirements and the 3 categories that surprised us most:  
     - *Wait, that’s a requirement?*  
     - *We thought this was covered!*  
     - *How do we even implement this?*  

3. **Sprinting Through the Verification Process**  
   - **Philosophy:** Default to "yes." If it’s not exact, explain why it still works.
   - Triage mode: How we categorized requirements into "Already done, just document", "Quick wins" and "Needs deep work" challenges.  
   - Tools and techniques for efficient compliance testing.

4. **Lessons Beyond Compliance**  
   - Unexpected wins: How CASA uncovered hidden risks and improved our overall security.  
   - The long-term benefits of aligning with industry standards.  

5. **Strategies for CASA Certification**  
   - Practical tips for preparing, prioritizing, and passing the CASA assessment.  
   - Building a culture of security and compliance within your team.
